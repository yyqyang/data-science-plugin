# Experiment Plan: [Experiment Name]

## Hypothesis / Research Question
[Supervised: What we expect to happen and why. Unsupervised: What structure or patterns are we looking for? Time-series: What temporal pattern or forecasting improvement do we expect?]

## Background
[Why this experiment? What prior work informs it?]

## Methodology

### Data
- **Dataset:** [Name and version]
- **Date range:** [Training and evaluation periods]
- **Split strategy:** [How data will be divided]
- **Temporal characteristics:** [Time-series: frequency, stationarity assessment, differencing applied]

### Features
- **Feature set:** [Description or reference to feature list]
- **New features:** [Any new features being tested]
- **Leakage check:** [Supervised: confirmed clean / pending review. Unsupervised: N/A]

### Model
- **Algorithm:** [What model(s) to train or compare]
- **Hyperparameters:** [Starting values and search strategy]
- **Model order:** [Time-series forecasting: ARIMA (p,d,q), seasonal (P,D,Q,s), or ETS parameters]
- **Forecast horizon:** [Time-series forecasting: number of steps ahead to predict]
- **Data format:** [Temporal supervised: confirmed (n_samples, n_channels, n_timepoints) shape]
- **Distance metric:** [Temporal supervised/unsupervised: DTW, Euclidean, LCSS, etc.]
- **Algorithm category:** [Temporal supervised: convolution-based, distance-based, shapelet, deep learning, hybrid]
- **Averaging method:** [Temporal unsupervised: barycentric, shift-invariant, etc.]
- **Anomaly type:** [Anomaly detection: point, subsequence, or collection-level]
- **Window size:** [Anomaly detection: for matrix profile methods]
- **Threshold strategy:** [Anomaly detection: percentile, domain-specific, or statistical]
- **Detection approach:** [Anomaly detection: semi-supervised (labeled normal data) or unsupervised]
- **Baseline:** [Supervised: what we're comparing against. Unsupervised: algorithm comparison protocol. Time-series: naive or seasonal naive forecast. Temporal supervised: 1-NN Euclidean distance]

### Evaluation
- **Primary metric:** [Supervised: metric name and why. Unsupervised: internal metric (silhouette, Davies-Bouldin, explained variance). Time-series forecasting: forecast accuracy metric (RMSE, MAE, MAPE). Temporal supervised: accuracy, F1. Anomaly detection: range-based F-score, ROC AUC]
- **Secondary metrics:** [List]
- **Slices to evaluate:** [Supervised: important subgroups. Unsupervised: cluster profiles]
- **Stability assessment:** [Unsupervised/temporal unsupervised: resampling strategy for consistency check]

## Reproducibility
- **Random seed:** [Value]
- **Environment:** [Python version, key library versions]
- **Data snapshot:** [How to get the exact data version]
