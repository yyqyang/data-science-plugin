# Data Science Plugin

Data science and ML workflow tools that compound institutional knowledge. 9 agents, 8 commands, 18 skills for problem framing, preprocessing, validation, EDA, experimentation, review, deployment, and knowledge compounding.

## Install

Add the repo as a marketplace, then install:

```
/plugin marketplace add andikarachman/data-science-plugin
/plugin install ds@data-science-plugin
```

## Prerequisites

The plugin's skills and agents use Python libraries for data analysis. Install them into your active environment:

```bash
uv pip install pandas scikit-learn scipy statsmodels numpy
```

Optional libraries (visualization, advanced models, and high-performance DataFrames):

```bash
uv pip install matplotlib seaborn aeon xgboost lightgbm shap polars
```

Run `/ds:setup` to check which libraries are installed.

## Workflow

```
Frame -> Preprocess -> Validate -> Explore -> Experiment -> Review -> Ship -> Compound -> Repeat
```

|---------|---------|
| `/ds:plan` | Frame business questions as DS problems and plan approach |
| `/ds:preprocess` | Clean, validate, and transform raw data with automated pipelines |
| `/ds:validate` | Run formal data quality validation with expectation suites |
| `/ds:eda` | Run structured exploratory data analysis |

## Example Usage

### Starting a new project

```
/ds:plan We need to predict customer churn for our SaaS product.
         We have 2 years of usage logs, billing data, and support tickets.
         The business wants to identify at-risk customers 30 days before they cancel.
```

### Preprocessing raw data

```
/ds:preprocess ./data/raw/customers.csv
```

### Validating data quality

```
/ds:validate ./data/preprocessed/customers-clean.csv
```

### Exploring a dataset

```
/ds:eda ./data/customers.parquet
```

### Running an experiment

```
/ds:experiment Hypothesis: Adding rolling 7-day usage features will improve
               churn prediction AUC by >2% over the baseline feature set.
```

### Reviewing an experiment

```
/ds:review docs/ds/experiments/2026-02-24-churn-xgb-result.md
```

### Shipping a model

```
/ds:ship docs/ds/experiments/2026-02-24-churn-xgb-result.md
```

### Capturing learnings

```
/ds:compound The churn experiment showed that recency features (days since
             last login, days since last support ticket) were more predictive
             than aggregate features (total logins, total tickets).
```

## Compounding Mechanism

The plugin creates `docs/ds/learnings/` in your project with YAML-frontmattered files. `/ds:plan` and `/ds:experiment` search these before starting new work.

```
docs/ds/learnings/
  2026-02-24-churn-recency-features.md
  2026-02-20-temporal-split-gotcha.md
  2026-02-15-xgboost-tabular-ranges.md
```

Over time, your learnings directory becomes an institutional knowledge base that makes every new project faster.

## Philosophy

**Each experiment should make the next one easier.**

Traditional data science accumulates technical debt: notebooks that can't be reproduced, experiments that repeat past failures, and learnings trapped in individual heads. This plugin inverts that:

- Frame problems thoroughly before modeling
- Review to catch methodological issues early
- Compound learnings so they're reusable
- Ship with documentation so models are maintainable
